# Audionyx
Audionyx is a course project created by five students at the University of Colorado Boulder. It is an immersive 3D audio visualizer that dynamically generates real-time visualizations by processing audio from user-selected media links, or locally uploaded files.

### Running our application

Note: If you choose to host this program locally, please note it has to install several dependencies that take upwards to ~500 seconds to fully install on each machine. Once installed, the program can be locally hosted using Docker, and should be fully functional.

### The 3D Audio Visualizer's Features:

Input online media links: Supports various platforms and file formats, such as local MP3 files, and YouTube links.
Extract and analyze audio: Dynamically processes audio waveforms and key audio characteristics including intensity, frequency, amplitude, and tempo.
Generates a real-time 3D Visualization: Displays an engaging 3D visualization that responds to the audio in real-time.
