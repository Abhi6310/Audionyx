This project is an immersive 3D Audio Visualizer that dynamically visualizes audio from online media sources. Built by a team of five using JavaScript, it generates real-time visualizations by processing audio from user-provided media links.

## Overview

### The 3D Audio Visualizer allows users to:

Input online media links: Supports various platforms and file formats, such as YouTube, SoundCloud, etc.
Extract and analyze audio: Processes audio waveforms and key audio characteristics like frequency, amplitude, and tempo.
Generate a 3D visualization: Displays an engaging 3D visualization that responds to the audio in real-time.
The goal is to create a captivating, interactive experience that blends audio and visual elements seamlessly.

### Features

Real-Time Visualization: Transforms audio characteristics into real-time 3D graphics.
Cross-Platform Support: Accepts links from various online media sources.
Dynamic Response: Visuals respond to changes in audio tempo, beats, and intensity.


### Technologies Used

JavaScript / Three.js: For creating and rendering 3D graphics.
Node.js: Backend for handling media streaming and API requests.
