# Key Points
- Started with Connor showing the mp3 converter (for spotify and youtube)
- Next, Abhi went over his threejs visualization
- Then Alyssa went of hers, Hunter, and Agam's contributions regarding register,login,library, and database
- Tips: 
    - Start updating project more as we progress
    - Distribute the commits to three different days.
- Need separate file for release notes, or put in project notes.

- Plan for upcoming week:
    - (Connor) Integrate library with MP3 converter, uploading
    - (Abhi) Visualizer working now, we want to integrate it with the API that Connor worked on, so getting that
    audio to display on the website
    - (Hunter) Registration and Login CSS styliziation
    - (Alyssa) Library stylization, integrate MP3 converter with the upload and delete
    - Making sure we are updating our project planner (release notes, what we have done)
