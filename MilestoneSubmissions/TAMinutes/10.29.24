# Key Points

- We discussed potential obstacles when obtaining audio files from SoundCloud, YouTube, Spotify, etc. 
As we would need to convert these files, so determining alternative methods, or scrapping as a whole if 
we are unable to access a public API key.

- We also discussed our approach to front end, our website was not currently working due to Docker issues, 
but our approach thus far is to use Bootstrap, and go from there as we are unsure how we want the GUI to 
look yet as we get to understanding three.js and how the libraries work together.

- Some points of reference were to make sure we also submit what we completed each week and what each member
committed/completed throughout the week.
